# IControl 

A generic repository for field data collection.


## Explaining the concept:

The most important thing when talking about a big corporation healthy, is how the data is collected and how it's indexed and organized in order to help the managers to take the best decisions that will revert in actions to turn it into a better company, creating a continuous improvement flow.

### That is where icontrol will help:
#### During data collection:
-One repository for all collected data from the manufature plant;
-Automatically calculates the optimum limits for every single KPC; (future implementation) 
-Realtime charts right on the floor, so operator can take decisions right away in case of a not expected value;(future implementation)  
-Realtime messages sent to anyone in the company in a case of a out of spec KPCi entered;(future implementation)  
-Suggestions of a new target for every KPC will be informed when process is calculated as capable;(future implementation)  


#### During KPCs design:
-Easy change on KPCs at anytime;
-Easy creation of a new KPCs;
-Process FMEA working on background to suggest where to apply changes on the process in order to maximize the return over investment; (future implementation)  


#### Forms design:
-Allow to choose the name and type of each tag for filling out with data by the operator;
-Many entry types are allowed: 
    -Text;
    -Integer;
    -Decimal;
    -Files; (future implementation)  
    -Pictures; (future implementation)  
    -Radio button;
    -And many more...

-Data entry may be automatic from PLC; (future implementation)  


#### Repository data persistence:
-Any database may be used;
-All data is saved in only one table;
-Every single data is saved with the user that enters it, the user that changed it and the timestamps;
