1 Fix bug with dates from abstract class all models inherit - ok

1 Fix bug with created and updated user from abstract class all models inherit - OK

2 Create field iform many to many to user and field 
iform_perm (can_edit)
inspection_create_perm(can_create), 
inspection_view(can_view_all, can_view_own, can_edit_all, 
    can_edit_own) for every model.That will give permissions 

2 Default screen with all created inspections? Generic Statistics like max,min,avg, 
    qtd for every tag? Last 5 years and then last 12 mths and last 30 days
    
3 Create tag Date, DateTime and time for now or default value now, day, month, year, etc

4 Iform form should have where to point if should be used for creating an inspection or not.

5 Certify if tag type section is not being saved on db

7 Add and asterisc on the field label when field is not optional -ok

8- Show tree inside TAG for iform_tag dropboxes

9- Create Dashboard = multiple forms (copy app form)

10- Create a JSON interface as in https://spapas.github.io/2013/12/24/django-dynamic-forms/#id5 / https://github.com/abbasovalex/django-SplitJSONWidget-form

11- tree based json
<!--   var json =  {% for genre,structure in nodes|tree_info %}{% if structure.new_level %} [{ {% else %} },{ {% endif %}
    id: "{{ genre.id }}",
    children: {% if genre.is_leaf_node %}[]{% endif %}
    {% for level in structure.closed_levels %}}]{% endfor %}{% endfor %} -->

12- The final idea is to have this as form designer http://jeremydorn.com/json-editor/ and then, save data back
to the database using icontrol
13- Use this Dashboard https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE
